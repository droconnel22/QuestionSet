Introduction

I want to thank AlpaPoint for an exciting and difficult take home assessment. I chose .NET Core which is the modern
expression of .NET that can be run on all platforms, which is a big deal.

To run this code base, make sure you are in VS 2017 or VS Code with dotnet core installed. 

The testing library is NUnint which required a special port for dotnet core. 

Make sure to set the testing library as the start up project. Build the solution and then run all tests.

For QuestionSix, look for the output files in AP_QuestionSet_CSharp\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0\*.*

Make sure the outPut files in the test harness have 'copied if newer' set. Simplify press f4 over the files in the
input and output. Hopefully you also enjoy good poetry.

The SQL Questions I have included screen shots and the SQL scripts, I did not create a seeding file for the tables.


Thank you very much for considering me for your organization, I hope you enjoy the results as much as I had fun
overcoming them.

Warm regards,
Dennis O'Connell
